    //         A shoe is an item of footwear intended to protect and comfort the
    //         human foot. Though the human foot can adapt to varied terrains and
    //         climate conditions, it is vulnerable, and shoes provide protection.
    //         Form was originally tied to function, but over time, shoes also
    //         became fashion items. Some shoes are worn as safety equipment, such
    //         as steel-toe boots, which are required footwear at industrial
    //         worksites. Additionally, shoes have often evolved into many
    //         different designs, such as high heels, which are most commonly worn
    //         by women during fancy occasions. Contemporary footwear varies vastly
    //         in style, complexity and cost. Basic sandals may consist of only a
    //         thin sole and simple strap and be sold for a low cost.
